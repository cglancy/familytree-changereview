PeerTrees
=============================

Oh, the joys of public family trees. Someone edited Great-Grandpa’s Family Tree data and now Grandma is upset. No one likes it when Grandma is upset. Public family trees can be a blessing and a curse. They can help us connect with a cousin who has tons of family history information, but they can also cause headaches when data gets changed or deleted. *PeerTrees* is a social web application for peer review of *FamilySearch* Family Tree changes. *PeerTrees* allows you to view the most recent changes to Family Tree and offer feedback about those changes. You can “approve” a change or just leave a comment. You can also request your own changes be reviewed by other *PeerTrees* users. *PeerTrees* hopes to enable more collaboration and eliminate edit wars.

*PeerTrees* promotes collaborative research by:
* Showing you who made changes to your tree.
* Allowing comments to be attached to the changes.
* Letting users mark changes as "Approved".
* Allowing you to request peer reviews of your own changes.
